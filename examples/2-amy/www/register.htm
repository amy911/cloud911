<p>By creating an account, you acknowledge that you are <strong>at least 18 years of age</strong> and
	that you agree to our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a> and

	in for the first time.</p>

<p>If you are not 18 years old then you may still play the game, but the laws of the United States and
	the European Union are complicated and it's just easier if I restrict the creation of accounts
	to adults.  To play the game as a minor, please ask a parent or legal guardian to create an
	account for you, making sure to check "This account is for a minor" and fill out the permission
	form that opens when you check that.  Thank you for understanding!</p>
